1,Ronald Acuna,ATL,NL, OF,Batter,22.3,Combination of age and stolen base upside is what separates Acuna from the pack; but a 26.3% K% presents a risk that other candidates for the top spot dont have. In anything other than a 5√ó5 league (points; OBP); I would look elsewhere with the top pick.,,111,37,98,0.285,0.367,0.524,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Mike Trout,LAA,AL, OF,Batter,28.8,Turning 29 during the 2020 season; career low 13 steal attempts; and a much younger crop of generational talent establishing themselves in 2019 are why Trout is no longer the obvious #1 pick in dynasty. I still have him #1 in redrafts.,,113,46,107,0.299,0.442,0.631,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Juan Soto,WAS,NL, OF,Batter,21.5,Flipped hitting profile from rookie season; upping FB% to 37.2% (from 28.8%) and lowering GB% to 41.6% (from 53.7%). 97 MPH FB/LD exit velocity is 2.1 MPH higher than Trout and 1.4 MPH higher than Acuna. Soto is my #1 pick in non 5√ó5 dynasty leagues.,,108,36,105,0.296,0.404,0.553,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Cody Bellinger,LAD,NL, 1B/OF,Batter,24.9,Career bests in BB% (14.4%); K% (16.4%); average exit velocity (90.7 MPH); and launch angle (17.6 degree launch). On the flip side; OPS declined every month of the season (1.397; .998; .967; .952; .918; .891; playoffs-.549).,,110,43,110,0.288,0.383,0.598,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Christian Yelich,MIL,NL, OF,Batter,28.4,Here is what I wrote about Yelich in my 2019 Top 1;000: ú¶ posted the lowest GB% of his career by a good margin in August and September (46% and 44%; respectively). If he can carry those gains over a full season; the power breakout may not be a complete outlier.ù That is exactly what happened; with Yelich posting a 43.2% GB% and hitting a career high 44 homers. The fractured knee cap that ended his season supposedly wont have any long term effects.,,111,37,104,0.309,0.41,0.605,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Mookie Betts,LAD,NL, OF,Batter,27.6,Boston did well in the second iteration of the trade; nabbing Alex Verdugo; Connor Wong and Imaginary Brick Wall favorite Jeter Downs. Move to LA doesnt change Mookies ranking; but it is a ballpark downgrade.,,119,33,82,0.31,0.402,0.552,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Trea Turner,WAS,NL, SS,Batter,26.9,Power took a big step forward; raising average exit velocity 2.5 MPH to 90.3 MPH. Remains a speedster with the 2nd fastest sprint speed in baseball; behind onlyTim Locastro(Buxton is a close 3rd).,,104,24,77,0.293,0.35,0.488,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Fernando Tatis Jr.,SD,NL, SS,Batter,21.3,With a 29.6% K% and a 6.9 degree launch angle; you can look at Tatis 2019 in one of two ways. Either you think he got lucky and there is serious regression coming; or you are scared at the thought of what his stats might look like when he inevitably improves on those underlying numbers. Im in camp #2.,,101,35,99,0.274,0.348,0.531,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Francisco Lindor,CLE,AL, SS,Batter,26.4,Small step back in K%; BB%; GB% and sprint speed; but Im willing to write that off to his early season calf injury considering overall production remained strong.,,104,32,87,0.285,0.349,0.52,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Trevor Story,COL,NL, SS,Batter,27.4,Carried over the major improvements he made in K% and stolen bases in 2018 into 2019. One of the premier power/speed combos in the game.,,100,36,100,0.283,0.354,0.546,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Wander Franco,TB,AL, SS,Batter,19.1,Recently signed international prospects are the best class of prospect to invest in for upside value. The top owners in your dynasty league have been able to reap massive rewards by acquiring prospects like Juan Soto; Vlad Jr.; Ronald Acuna; Victor Robles and Wander Franco within a few years of their signing at bargain rates that were not commensurate with their universally agreed upon elite talent (I know; I know ¶ Kevin Maitan exists too). High School players selected in the MLB Draft dont get that same risk baked into their ranking. Its too late to get Franco; and rankings are starting to catch up; but there is still value to be found.,SEPT,13,4,9,0.277,0.341,0.445,4,,,,,,,114,33,113,0.316,0.405,0.595,17,,,,,,

13,Rafael Devers,BOS,AL, 3B,Batter,23.5,Ranked 16th overall in average exit velocity (92.1 MPH) and cut K% by 7.7% to 17%.,,98,33,104,0.302,0.36,0.549,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,Alex Bregman,HOU,AL, 3B,Batter,26,How much the cheating helped his production is an unknown. Relatively low 92.3 MPH FB/LD exit velocity is another red flag.,,103,30,101,0.291,0.403,0.538,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,Jose Ramirez,CLE,AL, 3B,Batter,27.6,Armageddon 1st half (.218/.308/.344) followed by a beastly 2nd half (.327/.365/.739) that was interrupted and ultimately cut short by a fractured hamate bone. Like Bregman; low FB/LD exit velocity (91.8 MPH) indicates some power downside.,,98,30,93,0.279,0.358,0.518,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Nolan Arenado,COL,NL, 3B,Batter,29,Steady as they come. 40 homers with a high average. I wouldnt sell on the trade rumors; because teams are already going to value him as if he had been traded; so might as well wait until it actually happens to make a decision.,,103,39,116,0.298,0.375,0.568,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,Austin Meadows,TB,AL, OF,Batter,24.11,When I ranked Meadows 54th overall in last years ranking; someone asked me what I was smoking. Apparently I was toking onsalvia divinorum; aka; sage of the diviners; aka its a plant you smoke and then you hallucinate; because Meadows broke out with a .291 BA; 33 homers; and 12 steals. He hits it very hard; hits it in the air; has speed; and has a strong plate approach.,,93,32,96,0.282,0.351,0.531,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Bryce Harper,PHI,NL, OF,Batter,27.6,Strikeout rate going in the wrong direction (26.1%); but power; speed; and walks are all in peak form.,,100,36,103,0.265,0.381,0.533,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,Yordan Alvarez,HOU,AL, OF,Batter,22.9,Hitting profile looks mighty similar toBryce Harperwithout the speed.,,93,35,104,0.273,0.369,0.542,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,Bo Bichette,TOR,AL, SS,Batter,22.1,Like Tatis; the impressive triple slash (.311/..358/.571) is considerably better than the underlying numbers; but Im betting on the underlying numbers mostly catching up to the slash line; rather than the other way around.,,93,24,79,0.282,0.34,0.481,18,,,,,,,118,34,95,0.296,0.373,0.542,15,,,,,,
21,Ozzie Albies,ATL,NL, 2B,Batter,23.3,Average exit velocity jumped 2.5 MPH to 88.8 MPH; although exit velocity on fly balls actually decreased by 0.3 MPH. Its still a good sign that there is another level of power in here as he matures.,,107,26,84,0.288,0.356,0.49,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,Gerrit Cole,NYY,AL, RHP,Pitcher,29.7,I dont factor in age with pitchers quite as much as with hitters because every pitcher is one injury away from a career altering injury. Young pitchers also havent proven their arm can withstand season after season of 200+ innings which makes them more risky than an older pitcher with more miles on their arm.,,,,,,,,,18,2.92,0.98,295,0,205,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Walker Buehler,LAD,NL, RHP,Pitcher,25.8,Throws the fastest cutter by a starter at 92.8 MPH (1.8 MPH ahead of 2nd;Marcus Stroman). Final hurdle to cross is how his arm responds after a career high 195 IP (including the postseason); which is a 34 IP increase from 2018.,,,,,,,,,17,3.23,1.01,230,0,191,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,Jacob deGrom,NYM,NL, RHP,Pitcher,31.9,Career high velocity on all of his pitches. Upped slider and fastball usage while ditching his sinker and minimizing the curve.,,,,,,,,,14,2.86,0.99,260,0,208,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,Gleyber Torres,NYY,AL, 2B,Batter,23.4,Exit velocities and K/BB are solid but dont jump out at you. 17.4 degree launch angle ensures healthy power production; and Im expecting continued improvement in all aspects of his game.,,97,32,106,0.283,0.352,0.521,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,Xander Bogaerts,BOS,AL, SS,Batter,27.6,Maintained exit velocity gains from 2018 and notched a career high 10.9% BB%. With only 6 steal attempts in 155 games; you can no longer count on him in the speed department as you build your roster.,,99,28,108,0.296,0.369,0.529,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,Javier Baez,CHC,NL, SS,Batter,27.4,Getting by with pure exit velocity and speed.,,98,33,103,0.278,0.319,0.52,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,Anthony Rendon,LAA,AL, 3B,Batter,29.1,From my 2019 Top 1;000: úWith a 13.7% K% and 17.7 degree launch angle; there is potential for a monster career season lurking in here.ù ¶ The monster was unleashed and it landed him a $245 million contract.,,104,32,108,0.306,0.382,0.56,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,Aaron Judge,NYY,AL, OF,Batter,27.11,Led the league in average exit velocity every year since getting called up in 2016. Smashed 15 homers in final 33 games to salvage what was shaping up to be a mediocre season.Update:Continued discomfort in his right shoulder/pectoral area puts his status for opening day in question.,,101,39,96,0.263,0.37,0.545,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,Keston Hiura,MIL,NL, 2B,Batter,23.8,Underlying stats profile as a low average; power hitting beast with a handful of steals. Ultimately should develop into more of a 20% strikeout hitter than the 30% he put up in 2019.,,88,34,96,0.268,0.333,0.507,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,Jack Flaherty,STL,NL, RHP,Pitcher,24.6,Velocity up about 1 MPH on every pitch and BB% was down 2.5%. Third year in a row posting well below average exit velocities against (86.1 MPH) gives hope the low BABIPs (.242) is a skill.,,,,,,,,,16,3.38,1.11,229,0,194,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,Shane Bieber,CLE,AL, RHP,Pitcher,24.1,Not a flamethrower but has advanced command over a 4 pitch mix. Batters were able to make some good contact against him with a 90.4 MPH average exit velocity against. Cole and Verlander both sat at 87.3 MPH for comparison.,,,,,,,,,15,3.41,1.09,220,0,195,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,Yoan Moncada,CHW,AL, 3B,Batter,24.1,Not quite the speedster we all thought he was; but power showed up in a big way; upping exit velocity 2.3 MPH to 92.8 MPH. .315 batting average (.406 BABIP) is coming down.,,96,30,89,0.273,0.36,0.513,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,Pete Alonso,NYM,NL, 1B,Batter,25.4,Alonso is going to mash no matter how much Manfred loosens up those seams.,,91,43,109,0.263,0.36,0.557,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,Manny Machado,SD,NL, 3B/SS,Batter,27.9,Career worst 19.4% K% and low BABIP led to a career low .254 BA. The lack of steals was easy to predict; but now you have to worry about a mediocre average too.,,92,34,102,0.278,0.351,0.515,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,Eloy Jimenez,CHW,AL, OF,Batter,23.4,Elite exit velocity and 31 homers in 122 games proves the power wasnt over-hyped. Has the ability to hit for both power and average when his K% comes down; and his minor league numbers suggest it will.,,88,33,99,0.283,0.335,0.53,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Luis Robert,CHW,AL, OF,Batter,22.8,New $50 million contract has Roberts hype skyrocketing. I already had him ranked #2 overall because of the elite power/speed combo; but a 24.7% K% and 4.9% BB% at Triple-A is almost all you need to know to realize the road to fantasy glory might not be a completely straight line.,,72,27,83,0.254,0.306,0.471,19,,,,,,,94,34,101,0.277,0.339,0.521,25,,,,,,
38,Freddie Freeman,ATL,NL, 1B,Batter,30.7,Underlying numbers are very similar to his past two seasons when he put up 28 and 23 homers; respectively; but this season he managed to knock 38 homers. For reference; he hit 34 homers in 2016; but his exit velocity was about 2 MPH higher than 2017-2019. Freeman might be the clearest example of the impact of the juiced ball.,,95,31,105,0.298,0.391,0.543,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,Ketel Marte,ARI,NL, 2B/OF,Batter,26.6,From my 2019 Top 1;000: ú13.7% K%; 9.3% BB%; 88.6 MPH average exit velocity; 92 MPH on FB/LD; and 28.7 ft/sec sprint speed. If he can start lifting the ball more and add some strength as he enters his mid to late 20s; there is a 5-category stud lurking in here.ù ¶ Marte added 1.3 MPH to his exit velocity and 5.8 degrees to his launch angle en route to a beastly 5-category season.,,93,26,88,0.293,0.352,0.512,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Carlos Correa,HOU,AL, SS,Batter,25.6,In the midst of a power breakout but rib and back injuries limited him to only 25 games after May. A back injury tanked his 2018 season as well; so its a legitimate concern.,,90,32,105,0.283,0.362,0.527,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,Adalberto Mondesi,KC,AL, SS,Batter,24.8,Underwent labrum surgery on October 3rd; with a 5-6 month recovery. Major surgeries that ruin your normal off-season routine is not a recipe for a breakout season.,,78,16,74,0.255,0.299,0.422,41,,,,,,,93,23,86,0.274,0.329,0.446,49,,,,,,

43,Kris Bryant,CHC,NL, 3B/OF,Batter,28.3,Exit velocity is just not what it was in 2015 and 2016 when Bryant looked to be on the verge of becoming a perennial top 5 pick. I guess well have to settle for merely very; very good.,,110,32,80,0.283,0.381,0.509,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,Matt Chapman,OAK,AL, 3B,Batter,26.11,Career low 21.9% K%; but a 3.6% jump in infield fly ball rate negated any possible batting average gains (.249 BA with a .270 BABIP).,,105,38,96,0.268,0.355,0.529,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Mike Clevinger,CLE,AL, RHP,Pitcher,29.3,Upper back strain and sprained ankle caused Clevinger to miss almost the entire first half.

49,Justin Verlander,HOU,AL, RHP,Pitcher,37.1,Even at 37 years old Verlander is such a difference maker that he is worth a true elite prospect back in a trade.

146,Tommy Edman,STL,NL, 2B/3B,Batter,24.11,Way back in August 2016; just a couple months after St. Louis drafted him 196th overall; I praised Edman in myProspect Rundown: úLike clockwork; St. Louis has another mid-round draft pick (6thrd pick this year) who has immediately excelled in pro ball. Edman is slashing .305/.416/.473 with 4 homers; 5 triples; 12 doubles; and 14 steals in 52 games at Low-A. He has elite contact skills; putting up a 22/37 K/BB; which backs up his 57/76 career K/BB in 168 games as a 3-year starter at Stanford. His upside isnt sky high; and he may top out as a utility infielder; but I know better than to bet against St. Louis draft picks.ù ¶ please pay no attention to the fact he didnt crack my 2019 Top 1;000.,,83,15,54,0.281,0.33,0.451,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

746,Jonathan Stiever,CHW,AL, RHP,Pitcher,22.11,Plus fastball with two quality breaking pitches and a developing change. Broke out in the 2nd half at Double-A with a pitching line of 2.15/0.97/77/13 in 71 IP.,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,4.03,1.28,173,0,176
747,Griffin Conine,TOR,AL, OF,Batter,22.9,Put up great power numbers at Full-A with 22 homers and a .946 OPS; but a 35.9% K% as a 21/22 year old at that level is very concerning.,2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52,16,64,0.232,0.315,0.443,3,,,,,,

749,Noah Song,BOS,AL, RHP,Pitcher,22.1,Navy is not likely to grant him a service deferment; which means he may have to serve two years before continuing his professional baseball career. He fell in the draft to 137th overall because of that risk; but on merit alone he likely would have been drafted within the first two rounds. He throws a mid 90s fastball with a slider and changeup that flash plus. What his stuff looks like after two years off is anyones guess.,2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,4.23,1.35,103,0,96

753,Kyle Freeland,COL,NL, LHP,Pitcher,26.11,Imploded with a 6.73 ERA in 104 IP. Pitching half his games at Coors with a 92.2 MPH fastball and low strikeout rate is not a recipe for success.,,,,,,,,,9,4.67,1.4,133,0,160,,,,,,,,,,,,,

760,Drew Pomeranz,SD,NL, SU,Reliever,31.4,Excelled when he moved to the bullpen in Milwaukee with a 2.39 ERA and 45/8 K/BB in 26.1 IP. San Diego is obviously a believer; giving him $34 million over 4 years.,,,,,,,,,4,3.63,1.24,88,0,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,
761,Pedro Baez,LAD,NL, SU,Reliever,32.1,Likely the next man up in LA; althoughBlake Treinencould work his way into the mix. Baez throws a 96 MPH fastball with two quality secondaries in his slider and change.,,,,,,,,,4,3.42,1.16,66,0,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,

764,Bryan Abreu,HOU,AL, RHP,Pitcher,23,95.1 MPH fastball with two plus breaking balls. Strikeout machine (12.4 K/9); but lack of fastball control (5.3 BB/9) could relegate him to an elite pen option.,,,,,,,,,3,4.02,1.32,66,0,55,,,,,,,,6,3.54,1.24,113,0,91

769,Mike Siani,CIN,NL, OF,Batter,20.8,Full season debut wasnt great (.672 OPS); but he displayed a solid plate approach (20.5% K%/8.7% BB%) with plus speed (45 steals) and developing power (6 homers).,2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82,16,64,0.269,0.341,0.42,22,,,,,,

771,Diego Cartaya,LAD,NL, C,Batter,18.7,Moved to stateside ball after just 13 games in the Dominican League and more than held his own; slashing .296/.353/.437 with 3 homers and a 31/11 K/BB in 36 games.

772,Bo Naylor,CLE,AL, C,Batter,20.1,Solid full season debut; slashing .243/.313/.421 with 11 homers; 7 steals; and a 104/43 K/BB in 107 games. Average to above average offensive tools across the board.,2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,66,20,74,0.271,0.344,0.441,6,,,,,,
773,Bryan Mata,BOS,AL, RHP,Pitcher,20.11,Control took a major step forward; cutting his walk rate from 7.3 BB/9 in 2018 to 3.6 BB/9 in 2019. Big time stuff; but still needs to work on command and refining secondaries.,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,4.14,1.33,161,0,169

782,Cameron Maybin,DET,AL, OF,Batter,33,It took the former top prospect 13 years to break out; but better late than never as his raw talent is still intact. He did it on the back of a career high 88.8 MPH exit velocity and a 39.4% FB%; which he combined with his already above average speed and strong walk rates. Should have close to everyday at bats in Detroit.,,66,15,48,0.255,0.338,0.418,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
783,Chance Sisco,BAL,AL, C,Batter,25.1,Above average exit velocity (93.7 MPH) with a 15.9 degree launch angle shows the power will be there; but a 30.8% K% makes him a major batting average risk.,,48,15,53,0.243,0.331,0.419,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

786,Ronald Guzman,TEX,AL, 1B,Batter,25.5,Todd Fraziersigning means Guzman is going to have to earn his at-bats this season. A 29.5% K% and 85.6 MPH average exit velocity is not going to get it done.,,41,13,44,0.24,0.315,0.42,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
